[IMPORTANT]
We have decided to refactor the configuration mechanism. Especially, we removed the  `org.finos.fluxnova.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.FluxnovaConfiguration` interface. For now, each configuration is a `org.finos.fluxnova.bpm.engine.impl.cfg.ProcessEnginePlugin`. With this it is possible to hook into `preInit`, `postInit` and `postProcessEngineBuild`, which supports more complex situations.
If you have implemented a `FluxnovaConfiguration`, you have to switch to `ProcessEnginePlugin` (and its `preInit` method). You can also extend your configuration from `org.finos.fluxnova.bpm.spring.boot.starter.configuration.impl.AbstractFluxnovaConfiguration` to avoid a cast to `SpringProcessEngineConfiguration`.
